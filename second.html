    <p>Fried chicken flavoured nail polish - hell yeah!! Recently launched in Hong Kong, KFC's nail polish range brings together two of our favourite things ever - fried chicken and nail art. The promotional video above is a creative project by Film and Animation Director <a href="https://vimeo.com/helenclemens">Helen Clemens</a>. The range only has two colours at the moment but these are far from disappointing - "Hot & Spicy" is a fabulous deep orange, perfect for summer, whilst "Original Recipe" is a nude shade with black flecks. This trend is finger lickin' good for real!</p>
